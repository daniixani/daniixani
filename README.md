### hey, i’m daniela 🧠⚡

i build unusual systems that blend **signals, control, and code**. lately:
- 🔌 **Buck Converter in LTspice** — validated against design specs; swept load/transient & efficiency  
- 🧠🎨 **Brainwave-Art (C++)** — turns EEG features into generative visuals  
- 🧮💘 **Control-Systems “Dating Sim” (Python)** — toy feedback model for matching dynamics

**interests:** power electronics (LLC/WPT), digital design, control, HCI  
**currently building:** hex-coil WPT + EEG → device control
